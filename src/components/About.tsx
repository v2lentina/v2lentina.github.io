        <h3>Hi, I'm Valentina.</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a Junior Software Engineer, currently working at adidas. My work
          focuses on building reliable, scalable, and secure applications, and
          on learning how systems behave when they meet the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interests lie in the future of AI and security, and in technology
          as something larger than code - how systems fit together, and how they
          shape and affect society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I'm an Engagement Fellow at Amsterdam AI. I like to
          spend my time at hackathons, keeping up with new technologies, and
          staying connected to the tech community in Amsterdam, where I'm based.
        </p>
        <p>You can find me on LinkedIn or explore my work on GitHub.</p>
